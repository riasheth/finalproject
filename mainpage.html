      Welcome to the Dragon's Den! This is an interactive site in which you can choose a dragon and raise them. 
      You as the owner will have to feed, bathe, and play with your dragon for a certain period of time before
      the bonding level will be high enough to ride them. When you reach that level, you will unlock the special
      flight badge!
