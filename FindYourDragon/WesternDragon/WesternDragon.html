            The Western Dragon is a typical dragon with 4 legs and a pair of wings.
            They are carnivores with a diet of meat and seafood. Their size is pretty
            large. Also, they are big attention seekers and require a lot of attention.
            They are very loyal, along with being fire-breathers. They also have smooth
            scales. These are really great dragons to keep.
