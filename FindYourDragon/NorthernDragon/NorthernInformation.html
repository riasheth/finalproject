    <h1>Northern Dragon Facts and Information</h1>

  
    <div id="textbox"><p1>The Northern Dragon is for the most part an isolated breed. They are usually found in mountainous areas. Despite their name, their range stretches all across the (very flat) world. 
    Even though they are a relatively solitary breed, these dragons are much more tame than the other three breeds. They are quick to please, and are quick to please others. However, this behaviour has only been 
    observed around those they are familiar with. However, they are for the most part, the hardest to tame. They don't give their trust to just everyone, and are wary of even the most familiar people. Once you 
    earned it's trust, you have it for life.
    
    Appearance: Greyish-blue scales and a relatively darker mane. When full grown, their manes are crackling with electricity. They give out a blue-grey light at this stage. As a hatchling, they're scales are not 
    fully developed, and have a soft touch that can somewhat be described as silky. 
    
    Diet: Northerns are mostly herbivorious, but will eat meat if there is nothing around. Their diet ranges from the succulent plants to the coniferous leaves on pines. </p1></div>
